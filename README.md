# Space Waves Remake

General Information:
2D Python based of [Space Waves](https://de.crazygames.com/spiele/space-waves)
The Player is an Arrow that can move up (controlled by the Player) and automatically moves down and forward

The Arrow has to evade upcoming obstacles ad spikes that are planted above or below. The plain Ground and Roof doesnt kill the player, instead he flies straight forward.
The farther you get the more points you score.
Maybe later other Gamemodes will be inserted, like prebuilt levels

Code is made with Arcade (has to be installed to run the programm) --> https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/get_started/install.html
